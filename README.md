# Problem statement:

The main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in proper ways of connecting links and data in the website.

The task was divided into 2 main parts:
 * 1. Creating a Data Schema for the code
 * 2. Writing the code in MongoDB

 # Project Work Flow

* 1.  Importing Libraries

* 2.  Going with the schema and writing the code

* 3. Conclusion
